# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Complete Guide

## Introduction to OOP
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using objects and classes. It helps in making code reusable, scalable, and easier to maintain. OOP is based on four main principles:

1. **Encapsulation** - Wrapping data and functions into a single unit (class) to protect and control access.
2. **Inheritance** - Allowing one class to inherit properties and behavior from another class.
3. **Polymorphism** - The ability of methods or functions to take multiple forms (compile-time and runtime polymorphism).
4. **Abstraction** - Hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionalities.

## OOP Topics Covered:

### 1. **Encapsulation**
- Wrapping up data and functions inside a class.
- Hiding sensitive information using access modifiers (private, public, protected).
- **File:** `encapsulation.cpp`
- **Explanation:** This file demonstrates how data hiding works using private and public access modifiers.

### 2. **Inheritance**
- Inheritance allows a child class to acquire properties and behavior from a parent class.
- Types of inheritance:
  - **Single Inheritance** - One class inherits from another.
  - **Multi-level Inheritance** - A class inherits from another derived class.
  - **Multiple Inheritance** - A class inherits from multiple base classes.
  - **Hierarchical Inheritance** - One parent class with multiple child classes.
  - **Hybrid Inheritance** - A combination of multiple types of inheritance.
- **File:** `inheritance.cpp`
- **Explanation:** This file contains examples of different types of inheritance in C++.

### 3. **Polymorphism**
- **Compile-time Polymorphism:** Achieved using function overloading and operator overloading.
- **Run-time Polymorphism:** Achieved using method overriding with virtual functions.
- **File:** `polymorphism.cpp`
- **Explanation:** This file explains both function overloading and function overriding.

### 4. **Abstraction**
- Hiding unnecessary implementation details and exposing only relevant functionalities.
- **File:** `abstraction.cpp`
- **Explanation:** Demonstrates how abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and pure virtual functions.

### 5. **Constructors in OOP**
- **Non-Parameterized Constructor:** A constructor without parameters.
- **Parameterized Constructor:** A constructor that takes arguments.
- **Copy Constructor:** A constructor that copies an object.
- **File:** `constructors.cpp`
- **Explanation:** Explains different types of constructors in C++.

### 6. **Static Keyword**
- **Static Variables:** Retain their value across function calls.
- **Static Functions:** Can be called without creating an object.
- **File:** `static.cpp`
- **Explanation:** Demonstrates how static members work in C++.

### 7. **Virtual Functions and Runtime Polymorphism**
- Used to achieve dynamic behavior at runtime.
- **File:** `virtual_function_runtime.cpp`
- **Explanation:** Shows how virtual functions work and how they override base class functions at runtime.
